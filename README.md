# ReginaG
ReginaG is a chatbot designed to help kids deal with cyberbullies by training with a virtual bully in a safe space. Users cam interact with Regina over Facebook Messenger or SMS. Regina works with an Api.ai model trained with examples of bully-victim conversations and uses the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer API to determine the confidence level of the user when standing up to the virtual bully.

ReginaG was designed for HackRU by Ellie Seoe Jung (@ellieseoejung), Vishnu Ravi (@vishnuravi), Raghav Bhardwaj (@zathrian), and Jaya Kasa (@jayakasadev) and won the #HackHarassment Innovation Prize.
